                <img src="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Hi, my name is Dara. I am a 14 years old boy and I am a student at the Liger Leadership Academy. I am
                    so happy to study in Liger. Liger is an amazing school for me, teachers in Liger are really friendly
                    to us and when we do something wrong the teachers never hurt us by using their ability, they just
                    give us ideas or what to do and they try to explain more to make us understand it. One of my
                    favorite subjects is Math. I love to study math than any subjects but just so you know I am not
                    really good at math. For math class, I got four hours a week, Monday one hour, Tuesday one hour,
                    Thursday one hour and Friday one hour.</p>

                <h3 class="feature-title">STEM</h3>
                <img src="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>STEM class is really fun right now, especially when we are having an experiment with our teacher or
                    other teachers from outside Liger. Previous month we did an experiment with our teachers with put a
                    rock into coke and we all watch what will react between coke and rock. Yesterday we did an
                    experiment with a Master Engineer called Mark, which we all have to build a sand castle and the
                    castle that can hold the most book will win.</p>

                <h3 class="feature-title">Frisbee</h3>
                <img src="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>It was really fun to spend time with friends and play sports together instead of playing video games.
                    Frisbee is one of my favorite sports. I always play frisbee on Wednesday with my friends. Our coach
                    is Teacher Chanda. He was so good at sports and he is also one of my favorite facilitators. I
                    learned how to play frisbee since last 3 years. I start without knowing how to throw and how to
                    catch the frisbee. But guys, that is not a really big challenge for you, the biggest challenge for
                    you all is to practice throwing and catching it. The rules also just easy to remember but it
                    requires you to run just like playing football.</p>

                <h3 class="feature-title">Bamboo</h3>
                <img src="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Bamboo exploration is the very first exploration I have done. We learned a lot about the bamboo. For
                    the first week, we are just sitting in class and learn about the bamboo, watch some videos about the
                    bamboo with our teacher Sushi. But after that, we have started to brainstorm with our team to create
                    some products. After we brainstorm with our team about the products that we are going to create
                    already, we decided to talk to our teachers about the products that we are going to create and our
                    prove about what we are doing and we just start to create it. The actually did not recycle the
                    bamboo but we buy and use the new one because after we finish the products, there might be the peace
                    that left so we can recycle it. The products that our student have created is Bamboo lamp, Keychain,
                    Bamboo Pot, and a lot more. We spent almost 4 weeks on the products and now there is only one week
                    left so we decided to stop because we think that we have enough products to sell for our little
                    small market. The week left our teacher divided us into small teams for the Sharation which people
                    come from outside and see what we are doing. I am doing a survey for the Bamboo and some of my
                    friends doing to market and some of them are doing some play and it was really fun. After we finish
                    our market it was like all of our products have sold because many people really like our products.
                    We got around 100$ so we decided our team should have a movie night with popcorn at our teacher
                    house. And we have a movie night at our teacher house (Sushi) The movie was free because he put the
                    slide show and we also have some Pizza popcorn and some drinks like orange soda.</p>

                <h3 class="feature-title">Precious Plastics</h3>
                <img src="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Recycling Plastics is really fun and we also had helped to clean our environment. Previous month we
                    went to Siem Rieb province to Naga Earth and Rehash Trash to learn about their recycling machines,
                    recycling paper and we made some products. So we went there on Monday morning and in the afternoon
                    we went to Naga Earth to learn about Recycling oil, Recycling Plastic, Recycling Paper, etc. It was
                    really fun. We are not just learning we also had to create some products with some workers there and
                    with our friends. So after the trip end, we had back school and we a day on Wednesday that we can
                    share what we have learned to our friends and our facilitator. Not just to share we also have
                    created so many products for our little small market where our friends or anyone interesting in our
                    products can come and check out some new products made out of plastic or maybe they want to help us
                    to recycle plastic so they can buy it. So our products made out of plastic that people throw away
                    and some recycling stuff. So we did not buy the plastic bags to create new products, we just go
                    around our campus and collect plastic that we saw on the ground or anywhere that we can use. So the
                    idea of the Precious Plastic exploration is to create a plastic recycling machine but we fail to do
                    it because the problem is that we don’t have much money for those machines, and another problem
                    which one of the biggest problem is that it can cost our life. That’s why we decided not to create
                    it, but instead, we try to collect plastics and recycle it by our hand.</p>

                <h3 class="feature-title">Electricity Cambodia</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Electricity Exploration. This is round 1 of my year four at Liger Leadership Academy. I am
                    so happy to study and explore about Electricity in Cambodia. In class, we have been researching
                    electricity resources, the costs of it per, how much do we use per year and the imports of
                    electricity from our Cambodia neighboring countries. Our teacher had divided the whole class into
                    four teams. Each team, have one person working on multimedia, and the rest they do research and find
                    information about the category that the teacher provided. There are four main categories, those are
                    all energy resources, they are: Solar Panels Hydropower Thermal Wind Power. We went to four
                    different places during the exploration. The first place that we went to was, the Factory Phnom
                    Penh. We listened to the presentation by one of the Energy Lap experts about general information
                    about energy in Cambodia. The second place we went to was, ISPP. We went to see their beautiful
                    solar farm on the top of their tall buildings, asking questions, understand how it works, how much
                    money they spend without solars, and how much money they spent with solars. The third-place that we
                    to was Okra. It was located in Kampong Spue province. We went to a village in a rural area, which
                    only a few families live there, Okra was an organization, which they install free solar panels for
                    the family in some places, they charge money from them, but it just now much. In the last place, we
                    went back to the Factory Phnom Penh, which we listen to a presentation from an expert from the Blue
                    Circle, it was about the wind turbine. We had asked them a lot of questions about wind power, their
                    visions and their projects in Cambodia.</p>
